# Simple Interest Calculator

This project contains a Bash script that calculates simple interest given the principal amount, rate of interest, and time.

## Formula Used

Simple Interest = (Principal × Rate × Time) / 100

## How It Works

The script prompts the user to enter:

- Principal amount (P)
- Rate of interest (R)
- Time period in years (T)

It then calculates the simple interest using the formula:

SI = (P * R * T) / 100

## Example

If:
Principal = 1000  
Rate = 5  
Time = 2  

Then:

Simple Interest = (1000 × 5 × 2) / 100 = 100

## Usage

Run the script in the terminal:

bash simple-interest.sh
